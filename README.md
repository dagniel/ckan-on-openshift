# ckan-on-openshift
CKAN deployment configuration for Openshift


=======

# TODOs
- decouple postgres-gis deployment from CKAN-specific datastore initialization
- extra env vars: (custom)container ports
- refactor builder dir structure for postgres-gis
- mention: all current config for custom builds is done based on publicly acessibly repos; for private repos the BuildConfigs must be customized
- mention: for postgres users and passwords are generated from template's params by using expressions
